# MICROSERVICES

This directory contains all the microservices of the application. Each microservice is an independent module that can be developed, tested and deployed separately. The following is a brief description of the contents of a typical microservice folder:


    microservices/
    ├── {microservice_name}/
    │   ├── routers/
    │   │   ├── {version_number}/
    │   │   │   ├── router_name.py
    │   ├── schema/
    │   │   ├── request.py
    │   │   ├── response.py
    │   ├── dependencies.py
    │   ├── middleware.py
    │   ├── {microservice_name}.py


> routers/: This directory contains the FastAPI routers that define the routes for the microservice.

> version_number/: This directory contains the version-specific routers for the microservice. Example: v1/

> router_name.py: This file contains the FastAPI router that defines the routes for the resource.

> schema/: This directory contains Pydantic models that are used ONLY by the microservice.

> dependencies.py: This file contains the dependencies(short middlewares) that are used by the microservice. These are functions that are called before the route functions and can be used to perform authentication or other checks. An alternative to middleware class.

> middleware.py: This file contains FastAPI middleware that is used by the microservice.

> microservice_name.py: This file contains the main FastAPI application for the microservice. It sets up the middleware and the routers for the microservice.


***Each microservice should be registed inside core.app.py file.**
